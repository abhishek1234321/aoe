# Privacy Policy

Amazon Order Extractor processes your order data locally in your browser. The extension does not transmit your order data to external servers.

Optional permissions are requested only when you enable related features:
- Downloads: used to save invoice PDFs when you opt in to invoice downloads.
- Notifications: used to notify you when a scrape completes if you enable notifications.

If future features ever require data to leave your device, explicit user consent will be requested before any transfer.
