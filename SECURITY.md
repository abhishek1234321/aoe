# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest version on the `main` branch and the most recent tagged release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/abhishek1234321/aoe/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a minimal public issue and ask for a private reporting channel.

## Notes
- Do not include order data, personal details, or invoices in security reports.
- Dependency scanning runs in GitHub Actions (CodeQL, Trivy, npm audit).
