**First comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! I built this because I wanted to track my Amazon spending without manually copying data.

The extension:
- Runs 100% locally (no data leaves your device)
- Supports 4 marketplaces: amazon.in, amazon.com, amazon.ca, amazon.co.uk
- Works in the background so you can keep browsing

Looking for honest feedback on the UX. Any rough edges or missing features you'd want?

**Launch tips:**
- Post Tuesday-Thursday at 12:01 AM PT
- Prepare 5 screenshots showing the full export flow
- Have a 30-45s demo GIF or video ready
- Engage with every comment
