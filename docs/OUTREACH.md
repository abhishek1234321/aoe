# Outreach and feedback

## Goals
- Get honest, critical feedback on UX, reliability, and trust.
- Collect actionable bug reports without collecting user data.

## Where to post
- GitHub Issues (primary feedback funnel)
- Reddit: r/chrome_extensions, r/sideproject, r/productivity
- Indie Hackers (Showcase + feedback)
- Hacker News (Show HN, later)
- X/LinkedIn (short demo clip + ask)

## Post template (short)
Title: Amazon Order Extractor (privacy-first) — export Amazon orders to CSV

Body:
Hi! I built a tiny extension that exports Amazon order history (amazon.in/com/ca/co.uk) to CSV and optionally downloads invoices.
- Runs locally in the browser (no data leaves your device)
- Time filter support + progress
- Highlights view (total spend, top items)

I want brutally honest feedback on UX and reliability. Issues or ideas: https://github.com/abhishek1234321/aoe/issues/new
