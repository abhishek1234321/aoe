# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest version on the `main` branch and the most recent tagged release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a minimal public issue and ask for a private reporting channel.
